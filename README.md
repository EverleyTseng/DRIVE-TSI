# DRIVE-TSI
Diverse Road scene and Illuminance with VEhicles - Time-Spatial Images (DRIVE-TSI)

## Introduction
This is a open-source road time-spatial image dataset with vehicle annotations. Time-spatial images are converted from videos collected from the below datasets:
- Multi-Lane Daytime (MLD) Dataset
- UA-DETRAC: http://detrac-db.rit.albany.edu/
- GRAM: http://agamenon.tsc.uah.es/Personales/rlopez/data/rtm/
- NiTra: http://tdam-bjkl.bjtu.edu.cn/qzou/index.html

For each time-spatial image in this dataset, there is a corresponding `.txt` annotation file. The vehicles are annotated in the form of bounding boxes `[x1, y1, x2, y2]`.
